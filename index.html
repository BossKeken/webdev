                <p>Talisay, officially the City of Talisay (Cebuano: Dakbayan sa Talisay; Filipino: Lungsod ng Talisay),
                    is a 3rd class component city in the province of Cebu, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it
                    has a population of 263,048 people. Talisay was founded in 1648 as an estate owned by the
                    Augustinians. In 1849 it was converted into a municipality.</p>

                <p>During both the American colonial period and World War II, Talisay served as a haven of colonial
                    military forces. The municipality served as the center of guerrilla intelligence operations for the
                    Philippine resistance movement in Cebu during World War II. The returning United States liberation
                    forces landed on the beaches of Talisay on March 26, 1945, and were helped together with the
                    Philippine Commonwealth forces and the Cebuano guerrillas, an event that marked the eventual
                    surrender of Japanese forces on Cebu. That day is now an official holiday in the province of Cebu.

                March 26, 1945.
                The presence is part of the Victor II operation carried out by Gen. Douglas MacArthur to recover the
                provinces of Cebu,
                Bohol and Negros. This gave way to the liberation of the City of Cebu, 27 March 1945;
                and surrender of the Japanese to the province, August 28, 1945.
